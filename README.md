# hello guys, here i'm gonna explain how to use these projects
# in case of running the projects you just need to edit the input files :))
# use the excel picture file to figure out how complete your excel table

- For two-dimensional problems, we limit the degrees of freedom z. And for three-dimensional problems, we enter z degrees of freedom according to the problem.
- For horizontal and oblique elements, the nodes are named from left to right. (unwritten rule)
- For vertical elements, naming is from bottom to top. (unwritten rule)
enjoy :)
